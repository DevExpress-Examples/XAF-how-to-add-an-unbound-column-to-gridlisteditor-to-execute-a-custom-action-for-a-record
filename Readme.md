# How to add an unbound column to GridListEditor to execute a custom action for a record


<p>This example shows how to add a custom unbound column to the GridControl in ListView. In the example, a button will be shown in this custom column. When a button is clicked, a custom business action will be executed on the selected record. To be more precise, the boolean Active property of the Order business class will be reversed.<br /> To accomplish this task, we will declare a public SimpleBusinessAction method within the Order class. This will allow to reverse the Active property.<br /> To add a custom unbound column to the GridControl, we will create a new column and configure its editor as needed. To learn more about the GridControl's customizations please refer to the XtraGrid's documentation.</p>
<p>Take special note that XAF Web applications support this scenario out-of-the-box. You can make a method within your business class and mark it with the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.Persistent.Base.ActionAttribute">ActionAttribute</a>  with SelectionDependencyType=MethodActionSelectionDependencyType.RequireSingleObject. This attribute automatically maps a method Action into the RecordEdit category and thus will produce an inline action, which is always linked to the current object. Then, XAF will produce an Action column in the List View for your business class:

```cs
namespace YourSolutionName.Module.BusinessObjects {
    public class Contact : BaseObject {
        [Action(Caption = "Complete", SelectionDependencyType = MethodActionSelectionDependencyType.RequireSingleObject)]
        public void Complete() {
            // required code  
        }
```
