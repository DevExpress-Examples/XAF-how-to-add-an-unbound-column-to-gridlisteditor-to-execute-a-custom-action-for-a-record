# XAF - Add a Command  Column to a GridListEditor (an Unbound Column with a Custom Action)

This example adds an unbound column to the [GridControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl) in a List View. Column cells contain buttons that invoke custom actions. When a user clicks a button, the Action obtains the selected `Order` object and toggles the value of the `Active` property.

The following image demonstrates the result:

## Implementation Details

1. In the `Order` class, declare a public `SimpleBusinessAction` method that toggles the `Active` property.
2. Create a new unbound column and configure its editor. Add the column to the [GridControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl). For more information about [GridControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl) customization, refer to the following documentation topic: [Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid).

> **Note**  
> For more information on how to implement an inline Action in an ASP.NET Core Blazor or ASP.NET Web Forms application, refer to the following documentation topic: [How to: Add a Grid Column with an Action (ASP.NET Core Blazor and ASP.NET Web Forms)](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/404559/ui-construction/controllers-and-actions/actions/how-to-add-a-grid-column-with-an-action?v=23.2).
